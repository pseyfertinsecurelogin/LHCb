/** @file
 * header file which used to contain a templated implementation of matrix
 * inversion routines for use with ROOT's SMatrix classes (symmetric case)
 *
 * the file is still there along with the comment below to give users a
 * way to find the new routines
 *
 * an improved version is available with ROOT, for an SMatrix, you can use
 * the SMatrix::InvertChol method, if you need something on a lower level,
 * there is ROOT::Math::CholeskyDecomp
