! Package     : Kernel/XMLSummaryKernel
! Responsible : Rob Lambert
! Purpose     : Holds code for writing an XML-based summary in Gaudi
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!======================== XmlSummaryKernel v1r0p1 2010-07-19 =================
! 2010-07-18 - Rob Lambert
 - Adapt references for new Exception handling
 - Add check on gaudi return code
 - This is not the end of the story, because failure in the event loop
   is no longer caught in this new gaudi. So checking for success in
   the XMLSumamry is pointless.
