/** @class MCEventTypeFinder MCEventTypeFinder.h
 *
 * \brief 
 * 
 *  @author Rob Lambert
 *  @date   20/02/2009
 * 
 *  The MCEventTypeFinder is similar to the MCDecayFinder.
 *  MCEventTypeFinder uses the definition of event types in the dec files,
 *  and the definition in the LHCb note to classify a given event, MCparticle
 *  or group of MCParticles by their eventType.
 *  The EvtTypeSvc should be told the location of the dec files txt file
 *  e.g. if you have your own local copy, in Gaudi Python, do 
 *  from Configurables import EvtTypeSvc
 *  EvtTypeSvc().EvtTypesFile='~/cmtuser/Gauss_HEAD/Gen/DecFiles/doc/table_event.txt'
 *  
 *  MCEventTypeFinder is an implimentation of IMCEventTypeFinder.
 *  
 *  This is used in the TupleToolMCEventType, and TupleToolMCDecayType, where you should look for examples on how to use this class.
 * 
 *  METHODS:
 *
 *  There are three ways to get the event type of an event. The genheader, an educated guess, and the decay string (instant, fast, very slow).
 * 
 *  1) From the GenHeader    : see the example in CheckMCEventTool and in TupleToolMCEventType, and TupleToolGeneration
 *                             One type will be in the GenHeader, which will tell you next to nothing about
 *                             other decays in the sample, and not allow you to remove doubly-counted events.
 * 
 *  2) From an educated guess: using the event types definitions, from the LHCb note, all b/c decays in any event can be categorised.
 *                             An event type is "constructed", using the methods constructEventTypes()
 *                             This is quite fast, compared to searching using MCDecayFinder, and will categorise all b/c decays.
 *                             but the result is ambiguous.
 * 
 *  3) Decay string          : In each dec file a decay descriptor is given.
 *                             By searching the decay or event for all decay strings, the event type can be categorised.
 *                             An event type is "found" using the methods findEventTypes()
 *                             The result here is not ambiguous, but this takes a lot of time, and relies on all 
 *                             decay strings being correct in the dec files, which is not true.
 *                             
 *  MULTIPLE TYPES:
 *
 *  any event can, and probably will, have mutiple types. This is because of three things:
 *  
 *  A) Multiple decaying heavy mesons : Different decays will be of different types.
 *  
 *  B) Overlaps in decay desriptors   : perhaps the same decay is allowed in multiple event types, because they are ambiguous.
 *  
 *  C) Parent event types             : each event will be a subset of another event type. Bs->mumu is a subset of Bs->anything
 *                                      which is a subset of inclusive B, and inclusive B di-muon, which are subsets of
 *                                      minimum bias and minimum bias di-muon.
 * 
 *  The EventTypeFinder will return the full set of all possible types.
 * 
 *  OPTIONS:
 *  
 *  Types (std::vector) override the total list of types taken from the decfiles to a smaller sub-class of types
 *                      by default this is set to the total list of types.
 *                      Setting a smaller list can reduce the processing time.
 *                      This has no effect on the constructEventTypes methods, only on the find methods.
 *
 *  acc_min  double     define the minimum acceptance, in pseudorapisity, for a decprodcut
 *                      by default this is -ln tan (0.4 /2), i.e. 400 mrad, eta > 1.60-ish
 *                      you could set this to 2.0 if you really want "in the acceptance" 
 *  acc_max  double     define the maximum acceptance, in pseudorapisity, for a decprodcut
 *                      by default this is -ln tan (0.005 /2), i.e. 5mrad eta<6-ish
 *                      you could set this to 4.9 if you really want "in the acceptance"
