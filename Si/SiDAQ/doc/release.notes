!========================= SiDAQ v2r3 2014-03-17 =========================
! 2014-03-10 - Kurt Rinnert
 - protected all word constructors from overflows in inputs by proper masking.
   This fixes a rare (per mille level) off-by-one bug in the VELO digitisation.

!========================= SiDAQ v2r2 2012-11-26 =========================
! 2012-11-15 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added CMake configuration file.

!========================== SiDAQ v2r1p1 2010-06-18 ======================
! 2010-06-10 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix windows compiler warnings

!========================== SiDAQ v2r1 2008-06-30 ========================
! 2008-06-17 M Needham
 - Bug fix in SiHeaderWord decoding

!========================== SiDAQ v2r0 2006-12-15 ========================
! 2006-12-06 - Florence RANJARD
 - apply_pattern install_more_includes

!=========================== SiDAQ v1r1 2006-03-13 =====================
! 2006-03-10 - Kurt Rinnert
 - byte count for full cluster decoding iterator now contains the 4
  header bytes and is well defined under all circumstances.
 - corrected documentation of posadc_iterator::bytesRead() method according
  to the latest changes (now posadc_iterator::bytesRead() == RawBank::size()
  should always be true after the whole bank was decoded to full clusters). 

! 2006-02-24 - Kurt Rinnert
 - fixed off-by-one error in calculation of byte count

! 2006-02-24 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added new method SiRawBankDecoder::posadc_iterator::bytesRead().  The purpose
   of this method is to compare its return value to RawBank::size()-8 after 
   reading the whole bank as a consistency check.

! 2006-02-23 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added proper copy constructor and assignment operator. This allows caching
   of decoder instances in vectors, a feature needed by ST decoding.
 - added convenience accessor for error flag in bank header

! 2006-02-23 - M Needham
 - Try to please the windows compiler by casting u int to bool

! 2006-02-22 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added generic raw bank decoder template. This allows to share all
   common low-level code with the ST
 - added ADC bank type traits needed by the generic decoder. These
   live in the namespace SiDAQ
 - added buffer_word typedef to SiDAQ namespace  

! 2006-02-14 - Kurt Rinnert
 - changed m_value type in header word and cluster word to unsigned int
   and unsigned short, respectively.  This is to avoid binary complement
   confusion in integer casts. 
 - added include of iostream in SiHeaderWord (do we really need this streamer?).

! 2006-02-08 M Needham
 - Remove not need virtual functions

! 2006-02-05 M Needham
 - Make the fracStripBits public in STClusterWord.h

! 2006-02-05 - Kurt Rinnert
 - Changed type of m_value member in ADC word from char to unsigned char.
   This was necessary to make the encoding work since the accessor has 
   unsigned int as return type and the cast created binary complement 
   bit pattern for negative values of m_value (i.e. whenever the new 
   cluster bit was set).
 - commented out the unprotected std::cout in ADC word class

! 2005-12-19 M. Needham
  Add error flag to header word

! ======================================================================
! 2005-11-21 - v1r0
  M.Needham
  First official release of code
! ======================================================================
