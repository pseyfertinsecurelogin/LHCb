# SUMMARY OF THIS TEST
# ...................
# Author: rlambert
# Purpose: To check if the old DecodeRawEvent.py script still works (ish)
# Prerequisites: None
# Common failure modes, severities and cures: 
#               . EXPECTED: On modifications of the decoder db we expect there to be gradually more and more differences with the old data-on-demand way of doing things, and so soon this test is expected to be obsolete. Eventually the old Data-On-Demand way of doing things will be impossible and useless and this test should be removed.
