   VeloPhiMeasurement.
 - xml/Node.xml: 
   - Always make a new state when constructor is called.
   - New methods: hasMeasurement(), removeMeasurement() and z(). Reason: a 
     node does not require a measurement (e.g. it can be seen as an 
     outlier by the fit, or be a dummy node useful for the predefined 
     states).
