   MCHit and with in addition momentum of particle at entry point

!========================== MCEvent v1r3 2006-05-16 ==========================

 - Add ISiDepositedCharge interface

! 2006-05-11 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Use explicitly Gaudi::Units namespace in MCParticle.h and MCHit.h, to avoid 
   possible clash when also including the CLHEP files (e.g. in HepMC)

   const MCParticle. LHCb::MCParticle::Container, 
   LHCb::MCParticle::ConstContainer.
   These should be generated automatically by GOD from Gaudi v18r3 onwards.

   MCParticle.h.
   Change xml/MCParticle.xml to generate typedefs LHCb::MCParticle::Vector and
   LHCb::MCParticle::ConstVector.
   Change IMCDecayFinder hasDecay, findDecay, decayMembers, decaySubTrees 
   methods to use LHCb::ConstParticles and LHCb::MCParticle::Vector.

   when producing the hit.

! 2006-03-01 - Chris Jones

   history code.

!========================== MCEvent v1r0 2006-01-27 ==========================

   implementation is in new package Sim/SimComponents 

! 2005-12-15 - Marco Cattaneo

   RichEvent. Allows Gauss to be independant of RichEvent.
 - Port RICH classes from CLHEP to ROOT geometry classes

! 2005-11-30 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Migrate to GaudiObjDesc v9r1 (LHCb namespace)
 - Remove obsolete object factories from library

! 2005-11-15 - Gloria CORTI
 - Change package name to MCEvent in *.xml, for GOD Reflex dict generation
 - MCHit adapted to Event Model review reccomendations:
   . no longer a KeyObject but a ContainedObject
   . use of LHCb typedefs (to MathCore) for basic vector and point classes 
   . introduce new attribute for sensitive detector identifier (sensDetID
     with -1 as invalid number)
   . renaming of some methods

! 2005-11-15 - Patrick KOPPENBURG
 - New MCHeader class inheriting from ProcessHeader 
 - MCParticle and MCVertex adapted to Physics Event Model guidelines, remove
   some methods (ex. collision() to be provided by tools) and adopt MathCore

! 2005-09-06 - P. Koppenburg
  - Split package Event/Event into Event/MCEvent and Event/EventBase because 
    . Packages called Foo/Foo cause problems in cvs
    . Everything was depending on it which is not that nice since it contains
      MCParticle for instance
