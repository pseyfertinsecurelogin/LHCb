                data bank

  - HLTBuffer:  Holds event size(s) information and a buffer(raw array of hlt_int)
                with the data for HLT, following the Online Data Format prescription
                (LHCb note 2001-097). Should be filled at the end of the 
                digitization phase for each detector sub-system. Serialize and
