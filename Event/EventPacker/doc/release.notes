! Package     : Event/EventPacker
! Responsible : Olivier Callot
! Purpose     : Pack and unpack events classes for smaller events
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!============================ EventPacker v1r6 2009-07-13 ====================
! 2009-07-09 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add DumpTracks algorithm, previously in Ex/IOExample
 - Remove EventPacker_dll.cpp file, no longer needed with Gaudi v21r2
 - Replace all endreq by endmsg
 - Fix untested StatusCode on a Warning() method call

!============================ EventPacker v1r5 2009-06-29 ====================
! 2009-06-24 - Olivier Callot
 - Add the packing of RawEvent in WriteDst: All banks are copied from the input
   RawEvent to the output one, and the list of added banks kept in the output.
 - Add the reading of banks from a RawEvent object in ReadPackedDst
 - Fix the coding of the momentum error in PackedTracks in case of saturation.
 - Make Wouter's changes in UnpackTrack.cpp conformant to LHCb coding standards

! 2009-06-24 - Wouter Hulsbergen
 - Collect all LHCbIDs before adding them to track (slightly faster than adding them one-by-one)
 - Schema version update for PackedTrack: from version 2 onward, LHCb ids on track are sorted.

!============================ EventPacker v1r4 2009-03-09 ====================
! 2009-02-24 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix the hack in ReadPackedDst.cpp : Use a std::vector as temporary

!============================ EventPacker v1r3 2009-02-19 ====================
! 2009-02-19 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add hack in ReadPackedDst.cpp to compile on Windows

! 2009-02-12 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix gcc43 warning

! 2009-02-04 - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified ReadPackedDst to use the ODINDecodeTool to decode the ODIN bank.

! 2009-01-27 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix compilation warning on slc4_ia32_gcc34

! 2009-01-26 - Olivier Callot
 - New algorithms to pack, unpack and compare TwoProngVertex.
 - New algorithms ReadPackedDst adn WritePackedDsr to write in a RawEvent the 
   RDST content. Thsi allows writing a RDST in MDF format.

!============================ EventPacker v1r2 2009-01-21 ====================
! 2009-01-21 - Olivier Callot
 - Change the coding of cov_44 in track state, to be dp/p with a scale factor.
   Affects PackTrack.cpp, UnpackTrack.cpp and CompareTrack.cpp

!============================ EventPacker v1r1 2009-01-08 ====================
! 2008-12-16 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix a loop test condition in CompareTrack.cpp

! 2008-12-09 - Olivier Callot
 - Change logPacked to fltPacked in all occurences

!============================ EventPacker v1r0 2008-11-19 ====================
! 2008-11-19 - Olivier Callot
 - Import the Pack/Unpack/Compare algorithms for MCVertex and MCParticle
   that were in Sim/SimComponents
 - New packer for DST content, i.e. Track, CaloHypo, ProtoParticle and 
   RecVertex
