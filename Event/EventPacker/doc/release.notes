! Package     : Event/EventPacker
! Responsible : Chris Jones
! Purpose     : Pack and unpack events classes for smaller events
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! 2016-02-11 - Chris Jones
 - Fix a bug in the unpacking of related info objects caused by too 
   aggressive caching of information, that caused an attempt to access a 
   container from a previous event, and thus a serg. fault, in some rare
   circumstances.

! 2016-02-02 - Chris Jones
 - Add work around to the RichPID unpacking to deal with the change in the
   numerical value of the BelowThreshold enum, that means when old RichPID
   objects from before the additional of Deuteron are unpacked, the best
   particle ID field in the bitpacked word would would be wrongly set to
   Deuteron. Manually adjust this to Below Threshold in this case.

! 2016-01-28 - Chris Jones
 - Update (from Ulrik Egede) to support Deuteron in RichPID data objects.

!========================= EventPacker v5r9 2016-01-27 =========================
! 2016-01-22 - Chris Jones
 - Get rid of some unneccessary dynamic casts during the event loop in
   various packers and unpackers.
 - A few more C++11 updates.
 - Add some missing variable initialisation in PackPrimaryVertex.

! 2016-01-21 - Chris Jones
 - C++11 modernisation.

! 2015-11-26 - Marco Clemencic

!========================= EventPacker v5r7 2015-10-12 =========================
! 2015-08-28 - Chris Jones
 - Fix another bug in PackedProtoParticle::check where the use of data() to
   access the pointer was causing it to not be properly created. Should use
   target() instead which makes sure the pointer is created on-demand.
 - Improve the debug information printed with various checks.

!========================= EventPacker v5r6 2015-08-25 =========================

! 2015-08-25 - Chris Jones

   twice in the same event.

! 2015-08-25 - Chris Jones

   value was compared, instead of the memory location of the objects the
   SmartRefs point to ...

!========================= EventPacker v5r5 2015-08-24 =========================

! 2015-08-23 - Chris Jones
 - Add protection against null Track SmartRefs in RecVertex packer.

! 2015-08-03 - Gerhard Raven
 - remove #include of obsolete Gaudi headers

! 2015-08-07 - Chris Jones
 - Add some protection to ProtoParticlePacker::check to prevent potential out
   of range loop access in cases where the data containers in the two objects
   have different sizes.

!======================== EventPacker v5r4 2015-07-07 ========================

! 2015-07-07 - Marco Clemencic

   class ID to be returned...

!========================= EventPacker v5r2 2015-05-26 =========================
! 2015-05-14 - Chris Jones
 - Add a check to PackCluster to see if the packed data already exists or not.

!========================= EventPacker v5r1 2015-04-20 =========================
! 2015-04-16 - Chris Jones
 - Update PackParticlesAndVertices to only need to traverse the TES once per
   event to find the data objects to pack.

! 2015-04-13 - Chris Jones
 - Add support for packed Weighted Relations.
 - Update PackParticlesAndVertices to search for and pack weighted
   ProtoParticle to MCParticle relations.

 - Add support for custom RichPID objects in the 'PackParticlesAndVertices'
   packing.
 - Make packed RichPID objects key a long long.

   versioning added in the last commit.

!========================= EventPacker v5r0 2015-03-13 =========================
! 2015-03-10 - Chris Jones
 - Fix typo in MuonPIDPacker where version 2 was not declared as a known
   packing version in MuonPIDPacker::unpack

! 2015-03-08 - Chris Jones
 - Implement 64 bit reference packing for MCParticle, MCVertex and
   TwoProngVertex classes.
 - Add a warning message to reference32 to warn if any code is still creating
   potentially problematic 32 bit packed references. Method is retained for
   backwards compatibility...
 - Add checks for remaining calls to hintAndKey64 for corrupt references
   (should be impossible for 64 bit packing).

! 2015-03-07 - Chris Jones
 - Add protection to StandardPacker to prevent segmentation faults from a NULL
   pointer dereference in the case of corrupted reference information, due
   to truncation when attempting to pack it to a 32 bit int. Fixes issues
   seen when running over Stripping21 MC samples where some Track references
   in packed ProtoParticles have been corrupted due to data truncation. In
   these cases the smart refs are now just skipped (so set to NULL).
 - Update the packing of all remaining classes that still use 32 bit reference
   packing to use 64 bit packing. Reading is backwards compatible with old data
   using the packing data version flags. Consequently data written with this
   update can only be read by this version.

   of track and store in a PackedCluster container the Velo + ST clusters. Input
   and output names controlled as usual by InputName and OutputName.
   UnpackCluster generate the Velo and  ST cluster containers from the PackedCluster
   object given as InputName. If the option Extension is set, the clusters are
   created in containers with name postfixed by this extension, and the new clusters

   container all particles in a tree, all vertices and all relations between them.
   Options: InputStream, e.g. "/Event/Bhadron" to describe which part of the TES
   should be compacted. The resulting containers are directly in this location.
   The Pack algoruthm has an option 'ForceReading' to read all containers from file
   if needed.

   name, for tests.

 - Added a tool to dynamically configure the DataOnDemandSvc using rules (regex)
   to map the destination (requested) path to a source location, and a map of
   source class IDs to conversion algorithms. If a path is recognized as a
   candidate for conversion (e.g. intermediate paths) and the corresponding
   source path points to a plain DataObject, the corresponding node is created.
   See comments in ConversionDODMapper.h

! 2012-01-16 - Chris Jones
