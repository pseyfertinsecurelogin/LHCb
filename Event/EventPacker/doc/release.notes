!========================= EventPacker v2r12 2012-02-28 =========================
! 2012-02-21 - Chris Jones
 - Update the way some references to Particles and Vertices are stored, to
   use 64 bit integers, to avoid packing problems.

! 2012-02-17 - Chris Jones
 - Update the RecVertex packering and unpacking algorithms to support the new
   RecVertex class with track weights.

! 2012-02-16 - Chris Jones
 - Reorganise things a bit w.r.t. the Particle and Vertex packing, to avoid
   some code duplication

! 2012-02-13 - Chris Jones
 - Protect PackParticlesAndVertices against completely missing streams

! 2012-02-06 - Chris Jones
 - Add a new mapping tool to support the many to one Particle and Vertex packer

!========================= EventPacker v2r11 2012-02-01 ======================

! 2012-02-01 - Chris Jones
 - Patch PackParticleAndVertices to only create the packed output containers
   when there is something to pack.

! 2012-01-31 - Chris Jones
 - Add a VetoedContainers option to PackParticleAndVertices, to allow some 
   containers to be skipped

! 2012-01-31 - Olivier Callot
 - Implement the option "DeleteInput" in PackParticleAndVertices
 - Selection of containers by class ID in PackParticleAndVertices
 - Packing of RecVertices (primary) and Particle2LHCbID map
 - Option "ListRemaining" to list the containers in the input stream after
   execution of PackParticleAndVertices

! 2012-01-30 - Chris Jones
 - Implement the option "DeleteInput" in the packers used in the stripping.
   If True, the input data objects will be deleted after a successful packing.

! 2012-01-27 - Chris Jones
 - Add some protection to PackCaloHypo in case of invalid SmartRefs ..

! 2012-01-25 - Olivier Callot
 - New algorithms PackParticlesAndVertices and Unpack... to pack in a single
   container all particles in a tree, all vertices and all relations between them.
   Options: InputStream, e.g. "/Event/Bhadron" to describe which part of the TES
   should be compacted. The resulting containers are directly in this location.
   The Pack algoruthm has an option 'ForceReading' to read all containers from file
   if needed.
   The Unpack algorithm has an option PostFix to append this string to the container
   name, for tests.

! 2012-01-23 - Olivier Callot
 - New algorithms PackDecReport and UnpackDecReport to unpack/pack the stripping
   decisions. By default lines having not fired are removed. This can be changed 
   by setting the option PackDecReport().Filter = False

! 2012-01-17 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added a tool to dynamically configure the DataOnDemandSvc using rules (regex)
   to map the destination (requested) path to a source location, and a map of
   source class IDs to conversion algorithms. If a path is recognized as a
   candidate for conversion (e.g. intermediate paths) and the corresponding
   source path points to a plain DataObject, the corresponding node is created.
   See comments in ConversionDODMapper.h

! 2012-01-16 - Chris Jones
 - Do not abort processing in the Checkers, if missing data locations are found
   (Happens with Particles in stripped DSTs).

!========================= EventPacker v2r10 2011-07-25 =========================

 - Fix the UnpackTrack problem: An overprotection made in some cases the offset in case
   of wrapping of the (16 bit) index to increase twice, accessing random locations.

! 2011-07-22 - Marco Cattaneo

   also using UNLIKELY macro

 - Protect packers and unpackers from missing input data and also already
   existing output data

! 2009-11-03 - Christopher Rob Jones

   DataObject. Allows the 'version' of the data object to the be used to store
   any versioning needed in the original unpacked data.
