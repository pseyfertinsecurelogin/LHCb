   for the latest global tag and appropriate on-top local tags usage.
   Particularly:
   ReleaseNotes class is modified to attach the 'type' elements to global and 
   local tags entries in the release_notes.xml file when processing patches.
   Also corresponding changes were introduced into the CondDBAdmin_Commit.py 
   and CondDBAdmin_Global_Tag.py scripts. See help for right options usage.

   release_notes.xml file (under the given condition of fixed partition name 
   and data type) to return:
   - the most recent global tag and the list of all subsequent local tags for it;
   - the list of all global tags.
   Can be used as a standalone script.

! 2006-09-29 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Changed the browser's "Super User" menu into an "Advanced" menu with
   "New Node", "Delete Node" and "Delete Tag" actions. This menu is always
   available for databases opened in Read/Write mode. The "Delete Database"
   action has been commented out for now.
 - Cleaned up the requirement file.

! 2006-09-28 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - fixed a bug in guidialog.addConditionDialog which was preventing to reload
   correctly the payload of the selected object in the stack.
 - fixed a small bug in guidialog.addConditionDialog, which was displaying an
   error when trying to reload objects from an empty list.
 - modified the default selection behaviour of the addConditionDialog stack.
   Now default selection is on the last element of the stack, not the first
   one.
 - tried to fix the issue of default payload key selection in
   addConditionDialog but did not succeed so far.
 - tried to fix the "modal" behaviour of guidialog.conditionEditorDialog when
   opened from addConditionDialog, but did not succeed.

! 2006-09-27 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - fixed a small bug in guiwin.createDBSlice related to the changes in
   PyCoolCopy module new import "strategy".

! 2006-09-25 - Nicolas Gilardi - Marco Clemencic
 - Modified CondDB.payloadToMD5 to be compatible with multiple payload keys.
 - Fixed a bug in CondDB.payloadToMD5 which was preventing to retrieve data for
   non HEAD tags.
 - Fixed a compatibility problem with the PyCoolCopy version provided with
   COOL 1.3.2 version, which does not have the "append" function. The conddbui
   package now imports the full PyCoolCopy package. The "Append" button in the
   browser's slicing dialog is disabled if no append function is available.

! 2006-09-22 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Due to a misunderstanding of how payload storage worked, a major change in
   the behavior of conddbui.storeXMLString was necessary. the "data" parameter
   is now supposed to be a dictionary structured like the attribute list that
   will be stored in the folder, i.e. with the same list of keys.
 - The list of tags in the browser's data display is now correctly refreshed
   when selecting a channel.
 - The list of folders of the slicing dialog is properly cleaned when exiting
   the dialog.
 - copy_files_to_db.py can now handle multiple payload keys. They are extracted
   from XML filenames of the form keyname@foldername.xml.

! 2006-09-19 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - modified the interface to database slicing in the browser. It is now
   possible to select more than one tag at a time for a given selection object.

! 2006-09-13 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Created two new functions for conddbui.Tag objects: Tag.getAncestorTagsDict
   and Tag.getAncestorTags. They work pretty much the same as
   Tag.getAncestorsBranches and Tag.getAncestors, except that they return tag
   objects instead of strings.
 - Modified the display of tag names in the tag selection list of the browser.
   The name of the node where the tag is defined is also given between brackets.
 - Added a check box which filters out the _auto_ tags.

! 2006-09-12 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Created a new dialog class guidialogs.slicingDialog. It is called by the
   browser via the menu Database/Slice. It allows to copy data from the active
   database to a target database (SQLite) which may exist or not. This is a
   limited version of the PyCoolCopy.append function. It works, but need more
   tests.
   WARNING: as the PyCoolCopy.append function isn't available in COOL_1_3_2, a
   copy of the latest version is provided in CondDBUI/v0r4/src.
 - added the importation of append from PyCoolCopy in conddbui.py.
 - cleaned up guidialogs.py from obsolete dialogs.

! 2006-09-08 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Fixed a bug in guiextras.myDBTable
 - removed obsolete guibridge.py and recursive_tag.py files from cvs
 
! 2006-09-04 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Fixed a bug preventing to display single version conditions in the browser

! 2006-08-31 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed a bug in the copy_files_to_db.py script that was preventing to add
   data to an existing database.

! 2006-08-22 - Marco Clemencic
 - Added the script to create a DB from files

! 2006-08-16 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Completely changed the Add Condition dialog to take into account multiple
   storage keys. Now, you have to set the object information (IoV, channelID),
   and select the payload to edit in the list of keys, on the right. Pressing
   the "Edit" button will open an internal editor with one tab per selected
   key. You can edit the text from there (xml header is provided by default,
   but not verified). It is possible to load text from file, or to export the
   current text to a file. 3 buttons are also provided to help writing the main
   tags used in the xml data.
   When payload edition is done, user can "add" the condition object to the
   stack, at the bottom of the Add Condition dialog.
 - Modified the Create Node dialog in the browser. User have to provide some
   storage keys for the attribute list specification. Default is simply 'data'.
 - Modified conddbui.CondDB.createNode(). When creating a folder, a list of
   storage keys must be provided. Its default value is ['data'].
 - Created conddbui.CondDB.getFolderStorageKeys(). It returns the list of keys
   used by the Coral Attribute List to store the payload in the given folder.
 - Modified conddbui.CondDB.storeXMLStringList. The XMLList parameter is now a
   list of dictionaries, with keys 'path' (folder path), 'channel' (channel ID),
   'payload' (a dictionary similar to the attribute list which will be stored
   in the database), 'since' and 'until' (the bounds of the IoV).
 - Modified conddbui.CondDB.storeXMLString. It is now possible to give a
   Coral Attribute List key (which is "data" by default).

 - Created the guiextras.CondDBTree class which includes the database tree and
   the location bar of the browser.
 - Moved guiwin.myWindow.createLeaves and guiwin.myWindow.resolvePath to
   guiextras.CondDBTree.
 - Put back the possibility to open an SQLite database not defined in the
   dblookup.xml file:
   * go to menu DataBase/Open
   * in the DBLookUp Alias combo box, chose "SQLite file" (last entry)
   * this opens a file selection dialog. Chose the sqlite file you want
   * back to the open database dialog, give the Database Name
   * press Open DB when done.

! 2006-08-03 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Created CondDB.getAttributeList and CondDB.getAttributeListList (ok, not a
   nice name, but it is the best I have so far). They behave like
   CondDB.getXMLString and CondDB.getXMLStringList, but get the full contents
   of the Coral Attribute List in a dictionary instead of a single XML string.
 - Simplified CondDB.getXMLString and CondDB.getXMLStringList to reduce code
   duplication with the above new functions.
 - Updated guitree.guiChannel.setCondDBCache to store dictionaries of XML data
   instead of a single XML string.
 - Updated guiextras.MyDBTable._fillTable and guiextras.MyDBTable.showData to
   fit with the new behaviour of the guiChannel's CondDBCache.

! 2006-08-03 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Major modifications of the guiextras.myDBTable class:
    * It is now a horizontal QSplitter.
    * The text viewer is always visible on the left.
    * The panel on the right contains: the IOV/Tag filter, the IOV table and
      the payload selector.
    * Payload selector is a new element which will contain the keys of the
      Coral Attribute List stored in the database. For the moment, it contains
      only one entry named "data", but in the future, it may contain many
      different elements.
    * The text displayed depend on both the active line of the IOV table and
      the selected element of the payload selector.
    * It is possible to save the content of the text viewer to a file by
      pressing the button "Export to File".
 - Backward compatible modifications of CondDBUI.getXmlString and
   CondDBUI.getXmlStringList to which it is now possible to give a Coral
   Attribute List key (which is "data" by default).

! 2006-07-28 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Created a special environment variable $CONDDBUI_SESSIONS_PATH where the
   sessions.dbm file is expected to be.
 - Added support for "read only" and "read/write" access to COOL databases. Two
   functions modified: conddbui.CondDB.__init__ and conddbui.CondDB.openDatabase.
   Both now take an optional argument "readOnly" with default value to "True".
 - Major changes in the open database behavior of the Browser:
    * Existing databases _must_ be defined in $CORAL_DBLOOKUP_PATH/dblookup.xml.
      The browser provides a list of database aliases taken from this file.
    * Sessions are no longer user defined: the last 5 sessions are stored in
      sessions.dbm and accessible via the menu DataBase/Recent.
 - Modified the browser's exception catcher to display which function catched
   the exception.
 - Updated CondDBUI module documentation

! 2006-07-19 - Nicolas Gilardi
 - Fixed a bug in the browser which prevented to display the payload if an
   ancestor tag was selected.
