  > ConditionsDBGate.condDBImpl = one of CondDBObjy, CondDBOracle, CondDBMySQL
  > in this package it is an environment variable that must be set by hand
    - except for Objy where it is still inherited (no ambiguities on RH61)
- Move DB connection setup for Oracle/MySQL to base packages
- Rename cleanupDB as dropDB scripts and remove them from requirements
  > it only makes sense for Objy that will soon be discontinued
- SQL scripts for Oracle are still here, those for MySQL are in base package
  > those for CondDBOracle should also be moved in the base package
- Distribute new sample output logfiles
  > repackaged by platform and by technology
  > distribute twice the Xml examples even if technology-independent
  > update all scripts so that they are easier to run

- No changes to the code, just test that everything is OK
  > produce new reference log files
- Updated documentation: treat RH73 in the same way as RH61

    /afs/cern.ch/lhcb/scripts/CMT.csh already sets the RH7 environment
  > no need for a special README.RedHat72 file anymore
  > no changes to GaudiPolicy are necessary anymore on RH7: 
    in v5r7, the CMT tags rh73_gcc2952* are already defined
  > no changes to ExternalLibs are necessary anymore on RH7:
    in  v4r0p1, PLATARCH for rh73_gcc2952 is already defined
  > no changes to HTL are necessary anymore on RH7:
    GaudiSvc v10 already uses HTL 1.3.2.1 
  > no changes to XERCES are necessary anymore on RH7:
    release 1.6.0 already contains libraries for rh73_gcc2952
    (although they are symblic links to rh61_gcc2952)
- Remove reference to the Java browser until it's tested on Oracle

Requirements v4r0, private tag h20020725

==============================================================================
!20020717 - Andrea Valassi
Observed a potential problem. No change to the code.
- If you source setup from a directory other than cmt/, CMT seems to look
  for the setup/cleanup scripts in mgr/ rather than cmt/ sometimes.
  This had never been observed before: has something changed in CMT/LHCb
  or do I need to fix it somehow? It seems difficult to reproduce.

==============================================================================
!20020712 - Andrea Valassi
Minor modifications to the documentation

==============================================================================
!20020506 - Andrea Valassi
Upgrade to Gaudi v10r1 (GaudiKernel v12r2)

!20020408 - Andrea Valassi
A few changes in setup_Redhat72.csh as default CMT on Linux is now v1r11.
- This allows to simplify setup_Redhat72.csh with respect to that for v1r9
  > previously: default was v1r9, setup_Redhat72.csh set v1r10p20011126
  > now: default is v1r11, setup_Redhat72.csh keeps v1r11
Also a minor bug fix in dropCondDB.sql.

==============================================================================
!20011220 - Andrea Valassi
Simplify dependencies on the Gaudi framework.

==============================================================================
!20011216 - Andrea Valassi
Major changes due to tighter coordination with DetDesc and XmlDDDB packages.
- There are now two examples (with three separate job option files)
  > an Xml example that works both under Windows and under Linux
  > a CondDB exmple that works only under Linux
- A simple DDDB based on Xml files is released in directory XMLDDDB
- Conditions stored in the CondDB are now proper XML documents
  > read conversion from XML strings is handled by the XmlCnvSvc
  > write conversion into XML strings is still done by hand in PopulateDB
- The basic DataObject stored in the CondDB is now called Condition
  > class ConditionData is removed
- There is not an example of a derived condition
  > previously Temperature was used
  > is Condition generic enough that one should not derive another class?
  > writing derived condition is some work in overloading Cnv and update()
- Changes in folder description
  > classID are removed from all XML refs: remove it from folder description
  > assume that secondary storage type is always read from folder description
- Various changes in which detector elements are used for tests
  > Ecal is used to test all kinds of conditions in XML files
  > LHCb and Hcal are used to test slow control data in the CondDB
    - using XML strings created ad hoc by PopulateDB
  > LHCb is used to test geometry data in the CondDB
    - transferring an XML file into the CondDB
    - taking care that the DTD location must be internally reinterpreted
- Different notation for the condition folders:
  > folder /SlowControl/Ecal corresponds to TDS path /dd/SlowControl/Ecal
  > this and all other links are set in the XML files
  > no need to use BootDetectorStore anymore
- Remove ConditionsDBAddress (a GenericAddress of type CONDDB is enough)
  > also XMLSTRING storage type is not needed anymore
  > if the "file name" begins by "<xml?" it is reinterpreted as an XML string
- An improved DetDataAgent is used (specifying which DataObjects are loaded)
  > while DumpDetectorStore is removed
- Algorithm names are not changed in the job options anymore
- Various changes in messaging
  > simpler code using private methods in PopulateDB
  > test also the browseInTag iterator from the CondDB package
  > take INFO as default, use DEBUG only for more information, consistently
  > use VERBOSE tag for very verbose comments
  > use hex notation for all long long times
  > use more intuitive time intervals and temperature values for the example
Requirements v2r0, private tag h20011216.

==============================================================================
!20011130 - Andrea Valassi

==============================================================================
!20011129 - Andrea Valassi
- Remove the IConditionsDBDataSvc special interface
- BootDetectorStore bootstraps the detector data store

- TestSmartDataPtr needs not call the IConditionsDBDataSvc to boot the store
  > only TDS path names are used
- TestConditionsDBDataSvc has internal methods to test a normal data service
  > only TDS path names are used
