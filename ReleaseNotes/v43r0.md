2017-07-11 LHCbSys v43r0
===
This version uses Gaudi v28r2 and LCG_82 with ROOT 6.08.06.

This version is released on `master` branch. The previous release on `master` branch  was `LHCb v42r3`. This release contains all the changes that were made in `LHCb v42r4` and `LHCb v42r5` (released on `2017-patches` branch, see corresponding release notes), as well as the additional changes described in this file.

## Change to compiler support
**As from this release, support for gcc49 is dropped**  
This means that C++14 is now fully supported

## New or changed functionality
**[MR !622] Scifi: New event model**  
The changes in the event model correspond to JIRA tasks: LHCBSCIFI-79, LHCBSCIFI-80  
The default simulation is switched to the detailed digitisation. This is about 2 times faster that the current improved digitisation.

**[MR !766] Added missing implementation of function `DeFTLayer::quarters()`**

**[MR !638] DetDescChecks: Added material budget scan script**  
The script `matbud.py` generates maps in (x, y) by integration of one over radiation length and one over interaction length for a given interval in the z dimension

**[MR !698] CondDBBrowser updates**  
- Use Qt5 by default  
- Small fixes to absorb differences between PyQt4 and PyQt5  
- Add support for Git CondDB (read-only), see LHCBPS-1713  
- Closes LHCBPS-1502  

**[MR !761] Modifications to RunChangeHandler to force the name change of conditions**  
- New option to force updating the conditions during the alignment iterations. Since the alignment xmls donâ€™t change name during the job iteration, the default behaviour of RunChangeHandler would not allow to load the updated conditions from previous iteration.  
- A test for this new `ForceUpdate` option was added

**[MR !620] Relations: remove TO pointer value sorting from WEntry operator<**  
Addresses the issue with the Relations sorting that results in potentially unstable behaviour, by removing the sorting of the TO relations ranges based on TO pointer value.

## Code optimisations
**[MR !618] RICH MaPMT Support Improvements**

**[MR !695] Allow to compile VectorClass on avx512**  
**[MR !623] Update VectorClass to 1.28**


## Monitoring changes
**[MR !756] Add crate/slot id in `L0cte` verbose printout**

**[MR !656] `DataCopy.cpp`: in case of failure make the error message more informative**


## Code modernisation
**[MR !710] RICH - Prefer pragma once to ifdefs**  
**[MR !691] RichUtils - Streamline TrackSegment**  
**[MR !668] Rich remove pointless moves**  
**[MR !631] Access the Rich PD panel as a const pointer**

**[MR !676] FTDAQ: Merged functional changes from future into master**  
See LHCBSCIFI-83

**[MR !673] Modernize STDAQ / STTELL1BoardErrorBank / STDAQDefinitions**  
**[MR !750] Modernize Calo**  
**[MR !699] Modernize DetDesc**  
**[MR !773, !764, !758, !743, !726] Modernize LoKiCore**  
**[MR !740, !729, !646] Modernize LHCbMath**  
**[MR !655] Modernize PartProp**  
**[MR !651] Modernize LoKiMC**  
**[MR !650] Modernize LoKiGen**  
**[MR !649] Modernize LoKiHlt**  
**[MR !644] Modernize HltServices**  
**[MR !657] Modernize SimComponents**  
**[MR !658] Modernize FSRAlgs**  
**[MR !663] Modernize OTDAQ**  
**[MR !659] Modernize MCCaloDataFunctor**  
**[MR !654] Modernize LHCbKernel**  
**[MR !653] Modernize DetDescCnv**  
**[MR !648] Modernize LHCbAlgs**  
**[MR !662] Modernize DetCond**  
**[MR !652] Modernize MuonDet**  
**[MR !647, !712] Modernize FileStager**  
**[MR !661] GaudiObjDesc: replace BOOST_FOREACH with range-based for loop**

**[MR !665] Make the code forwards & backwards compatible with gaudi/Gaudi!290**

## Bug fixes and cleanups
**[MR !737] Remove unused public headers**  
**[MR !734] Fix compiler errors in uncompiled header files**  
**[MR !733] Fix compiler warnings in uncompiled header files**  
**[MR !721] Avoid calling `gaudi_install_headers` twice**  

**[MR !755] `L0DURawBankMonitor` was resetting the labels for some histo at each event. Protection added**


## Changes to tests
**[MR !763] Implemented complete checking of counters in logs**  
Up to recently, counters were simply ignored in the log of the tests (except their header and thus the number of them). This commit puts in place systematic checking of all counters, with a default sensibility of 10<sup>-4</sup>. So differences are allowed as long as they are small enough compared to the value.

**[MR !771] Increase VMEM test failure threshold to 1.4GB, to avoid false alarms**
