2018-03-22 LHCb v50r0
===

This version uses Gaudi v30r2 and LCG_93 with ROOT 6.12.06.
<p>
This version is released on `master` branch. The previous release on `master` branch  was `LHCb v43r1`.

This release includes the merge to `master` of the `future` branch, done in November 2017 - see !989 commit history for details of `future` changes that were included 

This release also contains all the changes that were made in `LHCb v44r0` (released on `2018-patches` branch, see corresponding release notes), as well as the additional changes described in this file.


### New features
- Add UnpackRawEvent, !1102 (@graven)   
  Algorithm that 'unpacks' `LHCb::RawEvent` into a set of vectors of pointers to `LHCb::RawBank`, one vector for each speficied `BankType`.

- Introduced VPLightClusters, !1069 (@sponce)   

- Added possibility to use the newly added HLTEventLoopMgr in Gaudi, !1063 (@sponce)   

- Allow to set the ThreadPoolSize in LHCbApp, !1059 (@sponce)   

- Add LHCb::span, LHCb::make_span to STLExtensions, !1057, !1075 (@graven)   
  - LHCb::span is a small facade to GSL::span to ensure that the boundary checking of GSL::span is only enabled in debug builds.  
  - add LHCb::make_span to avoid having to specify more types than strictly necessary
  - add a small unit test to test all features in STLExtensions.h

- Add `front` and `back` freestanding functions for gsl::span, !1148 (@graven)   

- Add Similarity_2_5, !938 (@sstemmle)   


### Enhancements

- Add support to RICH classes for complete SIMD vectorisation, !933 (@jonrob)   

- Improved Support for SIMD in RichDet, !972 (@jonrob)   

- Allow more flexibility in the template types used by the SIMD Rich ray tracing utilities, !1108 (@jonrob)   
  
- Rich decoding optimisations, !1137 (@jonrob)   
  - Fork the decoded data format for the 'future' branch, and update this converting the `std::map<A,B>` based model to `std::vector< std::pair<A,B> >`.  
  - Update the decoder to adapt to the changed data format.  
  - Various other small optimisations, to avoid temporaries and memory management overheads.

- Rich performance updates, !1118 (@jonrob)   
   - More optimisations to `RichDet` to improve the `MaPMT` CPU performance as required by the reconstruction.
   - Fork the `RichSmartID` tool interface for the future branch and add a new method to support SIMD coordinate transformations.  
   - Extend the MC truth utilities to provide access to the digit histories.  
   - Move from a private implementation inside the quartic reconstruction algorithm a new utility class that caches SIMD mirror information.

- Rich - Small optimisations, !1061 (@jonrob)   
  - RichDet - Cache more data in PMT classes to avoid multiple pointer dereferences and associated cache issues.  
  - RichDet - Improved (forward) support for 64 bit RichSmartID (developed in a branch for phase 2 upgrade studies).  
  - TrackSegment - Various small improvements, like use float not double for cached average photon energy.

- Rich - Convert interfaces to float + Minor bug fixes and improvements, !1009 (@jonrob)   

- Replace doubles with floats in FTDet, !1113 (@jvantilb) [LHCBSCIFI-84]  

- Added functionality to DeFTMat to improve speed in PrFTStoreHit, !1112 (@jvantilb)  

- Faster decoding of FTRawBankDecoding, !1079, !1111 (@jvantilb) [LHCBSCIFI-108]  
  Removing sorting and allocating memory for FTLiteClusters.  
  *  Allocating memory: about 15% reduction in CPU time  
  *  Removal of old sorting: about 50% reduction in CPU time  
  *  Adding back of custom sorting for PrFTHits: adds 10% increase in CPU time (about 10 ms, while at least 80 ms can be removed in PrStoreFTHits).  

- Update FTRawBankDecoder to deal with large clusters, !1039 (@sesen) [LHCBSCIFI-100,LHCBSCIFI-93]  

- Change trajectory hierarchy to have a templated version, !1089 (@mhadji)   

- Add a specific function for Track class to add states already sorted, !1060 (@mhadji)   

- Extend TrackFunctors to also accept references to objects, !1047 (@graven)   

- Enable vectorization of updateTransport by horizontal vectorization of MagneticFieldGrid methods, !1007 (@dcampora)   
  
- Changes required for kalman_no_ref_nodes, !998 (@dcampora)  
  - Added operator<< to Iterators.  
  - Added copy from std::array to TrackSymMatrix.

- Avoid temporary copies in RecVertex, !1072 (@graven)   

- Pass span objects by value, !1064, !1078 (@sponce)   

- Various cherry-picks from the TDR branch, !1056 (@sponce)

### Code modernisations and cleanups

- Modernize ConfigCBDAccessSvc, !1165 (@graven)   
  - use dedicated type for read-only/read-write property  
  - use string_views::to_string instead of equivalent free standing implementation  
  - use boost::optional<T> as return value instead of passing an uninitialized T by reference as INOUT argument, and returning a bool  
  - call `file()` less often / less implicitly, and instead assign the return value to a variable, keeping it alive in the local scope  

- Modernize LHCbKernel, !982 (@graven)   
  - do not provide default arguments in derived functions, as the caller only (has) to see the base class definition,

  - prefer cmath over math.h

  - fully qualify enum values

- Fixed usage of createODIN in read-split.py, !1003 (@sponce)   

- Modernize Tr/LHCbTrackInterfaces, !983 (@graven)   
  - prefer struct for interfaces  
  - remove CVS/SVN identifiers  
  - cleanup whitespace

  (cherry pick from TDR to master)

- Generalize Track{,FitResult} member function signatures, !1147 (@graven)   
  - Use `span<T>` instead of explicitly specifying container types in:  
       Track::addToStates,

       Track::addSortedToLHCbIDs,  
       Track::addToMeasurements,  
       TrackFitResult::addToMeasurements  
  - Put some asserts in the right place

- Modernize TrackEvent, !951 (@graven)   
  - add `final` qualifiers to Chisquare and Track  
  - remove CVS identifiers  
  - prefer `using` over `typedef`  
  - rename `middle` to the more appropriate `pivot`  
  - instead of replicating the `std::set_intersection` code to count overlaps, use `std::set_intersection` and customize it by using a `counting_inserter` which only counts, and does not insert...

- Removed Tr::TrackVectorFit::FitTrack, !939 (@dcampora)   
  As part of ths, refactored the Vector SOA containers into three files:  
  * VectorSOAStore: Stores the data in an aligned and contiguous manner. New store "backends" can be created if the initial storage is exhausted.  
  * VectorSOAMatrixView: Some generic Matrix views, to be used over the storage.  
  * VectorSOAIterator: Store backend-aware iterators.
