## Changes to configuration 
**[MR !867] Separate CaloAdcs and CaloDigits production on demand**  
Sets up separate decoders in DecoderDB for CaloDigits and CaloAdcs

## Bug fixes
**[MR !873] Fix an out-of-bounds read on a vector in DeRichHPDPanel**  

## Changes to tests

**[MR !865] Add support for Tesla tests running under 2012 data type**  
Some Tesla tests, in DaVinci, run using 2012 data and so set the DataType to '2012'. This MR allows Tesla to run with a 2012 data type, with the caveat that this is intended just for the pre-existing tests.
