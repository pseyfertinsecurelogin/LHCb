===

This version uses Gaudi v31r0 and LCG_95 with ROOT 6.16.00.
<p>
This version is released on `master` branch.

Built relative to LHCb v50r2, with the following changes:

### New features

- Add exec reports writer, !1716 (@nnolte)   
  Writes the nodestates into the TES, generic prototype version of a DecReportsWriter  

- Allow make_span with two span iterators as argument, !1694 (@graven)   
  
- Add BrokenLineTrajectory, !1693 (@graven)   
  A trajectory which is a collection of `LineTraj`. This is intended to replace the use of `PiecewiseTrajectory` in IT/TT.

- Add LHCb::range::single<T>, !1674 (@graven)   
  * class which can be used as a range of T, but which is actually a single element -- i.e. this looks like a vector which always has size 1.  
  * Useful if an interface is written in terms of a range, but one wants to call it with only a single element...

- Bypassing measurement providers for fitting, !1637 (@pkardos)   
  Adds data to the Track the parametrized fitter can readily use. Allows for the bypassing of measurement providers and costly indirect access via LHCbIDs.  

- Adapt to new Gaudi::Algorithm, !1608 (@clemenci)   
  requires gaudi/Gaudi!703


### Enhancements

- changed FT raw data format, !1709 (@sesen)   
  The new encoding and decoding version is v6. See detail in MR description  

- Return concrete trajectories by value from detectors, !1708 (@graven)   
  Instead of returning `std:unique_ptr<Trajectory>` return, by value, concrete trajectories.

- Fix dangerous DeVP::sensor interface, !1701 (@graven)   
  * deprecate `sensorOfChannel(const LHCb::VPChannelID channel)`  
  * add `sensor(LHCb::VPChannelID channel) const`  

- DeSTSector: use BrokenLineTrajectory instead of PiecewiseTrajectory, !1698 (@graven)   
  ... and make DeSTSensor return LineTraj by value instead std::unique_ptr  
  Note: this (implicitly) eliminates the (effect of the) bug in PiecewiseTrajectory! (see lhcb/LHCb!1695)

- No longer use states from fitResult in closestState, !1696 (@graven)   

- Add some standard debug sanitizer builds to PlatformInfo, !1680 (@jonrob)   
  
- Tweak v2::Track, !1672 (@graven)   
  * have setters return a reference to `*this` so setters can be daisychained  
  * make `setLhcbIDs` more generic so it can (also) accept lazy ranges  
  * re-order data members so that the most used ones fit in a single cache line  
  * remove headers which are no longer referenced

- prefer std::vector over KeyedContainer as output of MuonRawToCoord, !1652 (@graven)   
  closes #19

- Reduce the amount of sorting, !1646 (@graven)   
  * use std::nth_element to get the 'first' station/region  
  * then use std::partition to partition 'the same' station/region  
  * then call addCoordsCrossingMap  
  * finally, move to the next station/region  
  addresses a subset of #19

- Removed unused data members from Track V2, !1642 (@pkardos)   
  - ancestors: written only 2-3 times, but never read -> deleted  
  - extraInfo: 2 actual uses -> replaced by 2 doubles  
  - fitResult: never written (, never read) -> deleted  
  Addresses #16

- Small update to .gitignore, !1630 (@clemenci)   
  


### Bug fixes

- Update DDDB default tags following lhcb-conddb/DDDB#2, !1736 (@cattanem)   
  - dddb-20190206 for 2010  
  - dddb-20190206-1 for 2011  
  - dddb-20190206-2 for 2012 and 2013  
  - dddb-20190206-3 for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018  
  Fixes antideuteron name in ParticleTable.txt

- Fixed code checking counters/Histogram for when no ref exists, !1705 (@sponce)   
  The histogram checking introduced in !1661 had a bug that is only visible when no ref is present for a counter which appears in the output, and was causing affected nightly QMTests to fail with the cryptic error  
  ```  
  ERROR:root:Exception caught when trying to instantiate qmt test python object  
  ERROR:root:not all arguments converted during string formatting  
  ```  

- Add unit test for `PiecewiseTrajectory`, and fix `PiecewiseTrajectory` such that it passes, !1695 (@graven)   

- Remove unused variables uncovered by the compiler after !1668, !1671 (@graven)

- Resolve LHCBPS-1815 "Fix incorrect system path in git conddb", !1665 (@clemenci)  
  Fixes to `add_files_to_gitconddb.py`  
  - fix change of XML SYSTEM URLs  
  - add support for single file insertion  

- Adapt to ROOT 6.16 signature of R__zipMultipleAlgorithm, !1664 (@clemenci)   
  The change is backward compatible.  
  See https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3005 (master) and https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3093 (v6-16-00-patches)

### Thread safety

- wait for threads to end via tbbs observer, !1678 (@nnolte)   


### Code modernisations and cleanups

- Moved UnpackMC algorithms to DataHandles, !1738 (@sponce)  

- Remove dummy dependency on CORAL, !1724 (@clemenci)   
  
- Reduce scope of GOD generated operator<<, !1720 (@graven)   
  Should result in less verbose compiler error messages in case operator<< is used on a type (in namespace LHCb) for which no operator<< is defined, as the operators<< generated by GOD won't be considered as alternative

- Streamline MuonRawToCoord, !1719 (@graven)   
  * do not use Error(...) but instead throw exception  
  * put all code in .cpp file  
  * push some code into freestanding function instead of member function  

- LHCbMath - Clean up SIMD compilation flags, explicitly disabling unwanted extensions in specific tests, !1715 (@jonrob)   
  Explicitly adds `-mno-<xyz>` build flags as required to the various SIMD test applications, to make sure unwanted features are disabled, even if they are implicitly enabled via the `CMTCONFIG` platform setting.

- Fix incompatibility with gaudi/Gaudi!577, !1714 (@clemenci)   
  
- BrokenLineTrajectory: fix check for forward iterator, !1713 (@graven)   
  Fix to strict check for forward iterator -- make sure that more constrained iterators (eg. random access iterators) are still recognized as forward iterator

- added constexpr and removed a double promotion, !1706 (@nnolte)   

- Minor changes to help formatting, !1702 (@clemenci)   

- use C++17 std::clamp, !1700 (@graven)   
  
- Make DeMuonDetector::{Tile2XYZ,Tile2Station} const, !1699 (@graven)   
  
- UT does not require PiecewiseTrajectory, !1692 (@graven)   

- Migrate LHCb::TrackFitResult,Measurement,Node to Rec, !1691 (@graven)   
  * define ITrackFitResult as base class of TrackFitResult implementations  
  * resolve circular dependency between TrackEvent and LHCbTrackInterfaces by forward declaring classes in interfaces, and move UTHit to DigiEvent  

- Simplify muoncoord, !1670 (@graven)   
  - remove setters and instead provide constructor which fully constructs  
  - remove std::vector of tiles, as a MuonCoord contains either one or two tiles, and two tiles use less space than a single vector, and avoids extra heap allocation -- so use a boost::static_vector with a fixed capacity of two.  
  - remove explicit 'crossed' data member -- instead, use the # of contained MuonCoords  
  - adapt code which creates MuonCoords  

- make MuonTileID final, and remove explicit destructor, !1668 (@graven)   
  
- fix odr violations, !1667 (@graven)   
  

- change ICaloFutureClusterTool, ICaloFutureSubClusterTag, and ICaloFutureHypoTool IFs to accept ref intstead of ptr, !1662 (@dgolubko)   
  Addresses lhcb/Rec#42

- Decommissioning of COOL, !1638 (@clemenci) [LHCBPS-1789,LHCBPS-1813]  

- Fix compilation with gaudi/Gaudi!678, !1350 (@cattanem)   
  


### Monitoring changes

- Added exec counters to scheduler, !1703 (@nnolte)   

### Changes to tests

- Update LHCbTest to support checking of 1D histograms and profile histograms, !1661 (@jonrob)   
  Extends the logic used to compare counters to also compare the stats printed for 1D histograms and profile histograms.  

- Normalize HLTControlFlowMgr measurements, !1704, !1723 (@cattanem)
