!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!====================== Magnet v5r3 2009-06-16 ===============================

 - Fix a gcc43 compilation warning in MultipleMagneticFieldSvc.cpp
 - Replace all endreq by endmsg

! 2009-06-10 - Magnus Lieng
 - Added MultipleMagneticFieldSvc. This service takes other magnetic field
   services as input and calculated the vector sum of the fields when 
   fieldVector() is called. To be used when MBXW fields are needed.

!====================== Magnet v5r2 2009-02-18 ===============================
! 2009-01-27 - Marco Cattaneo

! 2008-10-28 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add missing includes for gcc 4.3 compilation

!====================== Magnet v5r1p1 2008-09-30 =============================
! 2008-09-12 - Chris Jones
 - Fix bug in updateTool( int polarity ) where m_fieldTool was only updated
   on the first instance for each field configuration change due to a scoping
   error.
 - Add finalize() method to release used tools

! 2008-09-12 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix an untested StautsCode

!====================== Magnet v5r1 2008-09-02 ===============================
! 2008-09-02 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Add an option UseSetCurrent to get Set instead of Measured current from
   CondDB (default false)
 - Remove a duplicate registration to a condition
 - Fix a bug in use case without condDB (was crashing if scale factor was set)

! 2008-08-01 - Marco Cattaneo
 - If MagneticFieldSvc.UseConstantField option is set, all other options are
   ignored

! 2008-07-31 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix uninitialised pointer to Real field map tools
 - Clean up dependencies in requirements
 - Remove unneccessary TestMagnet.exe. Test can be run with 
   "Gaudi.exe ../options/job.opts" or  "gaudirun.py ../options/job.opts"
 - Improve messages when scaling factor changes

!====================== Magnet v5r0 2008-07-29 ===============================
! 2008-07-29 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Revised implementation of MagneticFieldSvc
   . Service now gets names of field map files from CondDB. Can be over-ridden
     by FieldMapFiles option, previous options for field map are obsolete
   . Service delegates reading of map files and caching of map to a
     IMagFieldTool. There are two implementations: MagFieldTool for the real
     map, MagFieldToolDC06 for the DC06 map
   . On initialisation, service instantiates tool corresponding to current
     fieldmap type and polarity. If polarity changes during the job, a second
     tool is instantiated, and service dispatches fieldVector calls to the
     appropriate tool.
   . If scaling factor changes during the job, cached map in the tool is 
     rescaled. Scaling factor can either be set by job options or calculated
     from condDB data as follows:
     scaleFactor = Coeff[0] + Coeff[1] * (Measured current)/(Nominal Current)
  - Fixed options/UseRealMap.py for consistency with above changes. This file
    should now only be used if not using the CondDB.
  - Fixed option/job.opts with use with new DDDB+SQLDDDB options

! 2008-07-18 - Marco Cattaneo
 - MagneticFieldSvc now implements ILHCbMagnetSvc interface
 - Accessor methods renamed to scaleFactor() and useRealMap() to conform with
   coding conventions

! 2008-07-17 - Stephanie Hansmann-Menzemer
 -  move GetScale() method public, add UserRealMap() method

!====================== Magnet v4r0 2008-07-16 ===============================
! 2008-07-16 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fix (again!) bug for selecting quadrants with new field map
 - Remove polarity from calculation of scaling factor from conditions: polarity
   should be used to select different field map files (TODO!)
 - Move registration of condition to *before* parsing of field maps, so that
   scaling factor is correctly intialised from CondDB. NB, it's not enough to
   apply scale factor in file parsing, any change in conditions after parsing
   is not taken into account!

!======================== Magnet v1r1 update 2002-05-31 ======================
! 2002-05-31 - Edgar De Oliveira
 - Fix a Bug pointed by Rutger Hierck: When position y was set to zero
   the service was returning zero for By component of the field, what is not 
	 true.

 - Some float were changed to double and the internal function fieldGrid
   now returns void instead of a StatusCode that was not tested in any 
   circunstance. 

!======================== Magnet v1r0 release 2002-05-23 =====================
! 2002-05-23 - Olivier Callot
 - Fix a bug : When x>0, Y<0, the Y component of the field was inverted instead
   of the x component !
 - Added also a protection: Return a zero field when outside the field map.

! 2002-05-21 - Edgar De Oliveira
 - New version of MagneticFieldSvc (originally in SicbCnv).
   This version does not make use anymore of SICB utilities.
   The fortran interpolation of the grid has been replaced by a C++ 
   translation of the code.
   This version has as property the name of the field map file
   (property "FieldMapFile"). The default name of the field map will be
   $LHCBDASE/cdf/field043.cdf (if LHCBDBASE is defined) or field043.cdf
   in the local directory.
   The file is read in the initialize method of the service.
