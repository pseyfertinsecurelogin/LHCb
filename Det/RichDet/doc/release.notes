!======================== RichDet v15r0 2010-08-25 ===========================

! 2010-08-19 - Sajan Easo
 - Refractive index of CF4 corrected by using the correct reference
   temperature. This fine tunes the refractive index by shifting n-1 by about
   7 percent. This can be used with older versions of DDDB.
   The adhoc corrections made in conddb so far
   for real data can be removed when using this by setting the
   RefractivityScaleFactor" to 1.0 in ../Conditions/Rich2/Environment/Gas.xml
   For MC data this was always 1.0 anyway. All changes in DeRichGasRadiator.cpp
- Improved Refractive index of RICH2 gas by using a new parametrization
  from a recent reference.
   This needs the new DDDB modifications as of Aug20-2010.
   In case of using the old DDDB the above
   mentioned correction will be automatically used to give the same correct
   refractive index. All changes in DeRichGasRadiator.cpp

  + Add to the rms() and new standardDeviation() and optional weight function
    that can be used during the calculations if supplied to weight (multiply)
    the function.
  + Add a new static method combine() that takes a vector of tabulated
    functions, merges them, and returns a new function that represents the
    product of the functions.
  + Inline the constructors for speed
